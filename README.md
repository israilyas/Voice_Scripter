# Voice Scripter

Voice Scripter is a simple application that allows users to convert text to speech and speech to text using Python. This repository provides a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter, leveraging the pyttsx3 library for text-to-speech conversion and the SpeechRecognition library for speech-to-text functionality.

## Features

- **Text to Speech Conversion:** Enter text into the provided text box, select voice preferences (gender and speed), and click the "Speak" button to convert the text to speech.

- **Speech to Text Conversion:** Click the "Speak" button to start listening through the microphone. The recognized speech will be displayed in the text box.

- **Save as Audio File:** For text-to-speech conversion, there is an option to save the generated speech as an audio file (MP3 format). Simply click the "Save" button after entering the text.

```bash
pip install pyttsx3 speechrecognition Pillow
